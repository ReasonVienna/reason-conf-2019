# About ReasonConf

This conference aims to demonstrate that ReasonML is able to be more than a
niche language in the space of frontend languages. Attendees should feel
motivated to introduce Reason & OCaml in their professional context and also
feel comfortable with the currently existing tools. For that, this event will
provide a well balanced schedule with practical & theoretical content.

Another goal is to bring together contributors, lead developers and community
drivers of the Reason, ReasonReact and OCaml platform. During the conference
there will be enough time to discuss, innovate and synchronize on important
topics on the roadmap. Besides formalities, this is also a great opportunity to
finally meet people in person instead of chatting on Twitter or Discord.

To close our mission statement, attendees demonstrate that the Reason community
is for everyone. We encourage diversity, establish a strong community guideline
for a harassment free, more diverse environment and want to offer our platform
to give a voice to everybody.
