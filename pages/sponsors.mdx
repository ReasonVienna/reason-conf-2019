ReasonConf is a **not-for-profit** conference. [The goal of the event](/about/)
is to bring the global community together for at least once a year. Around a
third of the tickets are provided to our international communities and notable
contributors to the Reason ecosystem. We also provide a set of free diversity
tickets to underrepresented folks in tech.
