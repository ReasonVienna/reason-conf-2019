## What We are Looking for

This year's theme is called **On the Road to Production**, so we are looking for proposals especially covering following topics:

- Case Studies about ReasonML in production (deployed products, client projects, side projects etc.)
- Talks about development of Reason & OCaml related tools which help us advancing the platform
- Talks on Community development and progressing as a more technical / ethical diverse platform
- ...

If you think your proposal doesn't fit the theme, please propose it anyways, since we are totally open for new and cool ideas!

## About the Selection Process
This year, the selection will happen anonymously, which means that the selecting committee will only receive information about the talks and not about the authors themselves.

### In case you are not selected...

We try to find the right candidates to fit a specific theme and we don't have many speaker slots available, so please don't get discouraged if we don't choose your proposal right away.

We are a small community and we will try to push further events for the upcoming years, so that all of you have a chance to show off the topics you are passionate about <3

Also there is a chance to do a lightning talk on Day 3, which will provide an Open Stage for video recorded community talks as well!

## Speaker Benefits

For full length talk speakers, we will take care for the ticket & travel costs and accommodation during the conference days.
Lightning talk speakers will get a free ticket for the whole conference. For every speaker being confirmed after they bought a ticket, they will be directly reimbursed at the venue.
