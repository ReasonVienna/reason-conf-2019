# Call for Papers

We are accepting talk proposals for both full length conference talks and more casual lightning talks.

### Deadline
31<sup>st</sup> of January 2019, 11:59 PM CET

### <a href={cfpLink} title="Submit your proposal">Submit your proposal</a>

_By submitting your proposal, you comply to our <Link to="/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</Link>._

## What are we looking for

This year's topic is "**On the Road to Production**", so we are looking for proposals especially covering following topics:

- Case Studies about ReasonML in production such as deployed products, client projects, side projects etc.
- Development of Reason & OCaml related tools which help us advancing the platform
- Community development and progressing as a more technically / ethically diverse platform

If you think your proposal doesn't fit the topic, please apply it anyway, since we are open for new ideas!

## About the selection process

This year the selection will happen anonymously. This means the selecting committee will only receive information about the talks and not about the authors themselves. We'll do our best to stay close to this year's topic.

Please don't get discouraged if your proposal won't be selected â€” we don't have many speaker slots available. There is a chance to do a lightning talk on day 3, though. We will provide an Open Stage and professionally record videos of these talks.

## Speaker benefits

For full length talk speakers, we will cover travel and accommodation costs during the conference days.

Lightning talk speakers will get a free conference ticket. For every speaker being confirmed after they purchased a ticket, they will be directly reimbursed at the venue.
