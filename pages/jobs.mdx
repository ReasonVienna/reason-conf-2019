### ReasonML Developer

We are looking for a frontend developer to strengthen our UI team
behind ahrefs.com, with ReasonReact as the base of the technology stack. You
will be closely working with our designers and QA to build an ergonomic user
interface.

Basic Requirements:
- Proficiency and experience in ReasonML will be
appreciated, otherwise, a strong inclination to intensively learn it in the
short term
- Strong experience with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and React
- Elasticsearch experience is a plus
- Experience with other functional and
statically-typed languages (Elm, OCaml, F#, Haskell, Scala, etc.) is a plus

In this role, you are expected to:
- Translate design mock-ups into live HTML, CSS
and JavaScript
- Test for cross-browser, cross-platform, and cross-device
compatibility
- Understand business needs and user behaviour, and propose UI/UX
improvement
- Write clean & modular code
- Follow modern web best practices
- Work independently
- Bonus points for not messing up Git rebase

If your preference is leaning towards functional languages on the server side,
you may want to consider
our [OCaml](https://ahrefs.com/jobs/ocaml-developer) position instead.

We're always hiring software developers for all three of our offices. Technology is at the core of how we approach that work and developers are intimately tied in to every area of the business. 

We are big believers in functional programming, using OCaml, a statically-typed functional programming language, as our primary development language.  We also believe in the value of open source software, using it in our daily work and releasing hundreds of thousands of lines of our own code as open source.

You should have:
- Top-notch programming skills.
- Deep experience with - and love for - technology. There's no specific checklist; we use software to approach a variety of problems, so we're interested in everything from machine learning to systems administration to programming language design.
- Strong interpersonal skills. Software development at Jane Street is highly collaborative, and we are looking for people who can work effectively in small, close-knit teams.

We don’t expect you to have experience with functional programming, OCaml, or finance; we’re happy to hire talented developers and teach them what they need to know. If you'd like to get an idea of what we cover in our software development interview process, you can read our recent [blog post](https://blog.janestreet.com/what-a-jane-street-dev-interview-is-like).
